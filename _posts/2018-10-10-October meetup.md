# Presentations

## Mate Kovacs ([Indie](https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/mate-kovacs/id823066256)) - 1.5 years in the App Store as an indie developer

Iâ€™m going to show you what it looks like to make my own apps full-time and how it is different from having a job or from freelancing. In the last 1.5 years I released 15 apps and got 350k downloads working solo without founding and a team.

## Akos Boros ([Capturly](https://capturly.com)/[Tep](https://gettep.com)) - In Numbers We Trust

Finding the right Key Performance Indicators are essential if you would like to build a successful product. In my talk, I would like to show you how to find the best KPIs for your product and what kind of tools you can use to track them.
